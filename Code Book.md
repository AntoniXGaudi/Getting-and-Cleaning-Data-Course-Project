Data fields in tidy.txt:

Human Activity Recognition database built from the recordings of 30 subjects performing activities of 
daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors

Identifiers

    subject - person performing activities
    activity - The type of activity performed when the corresponding measurements were taken
    
Activity Labels

    WALKING (1): subject was walking during the test
    WALKING_UPSTAIRS (2): subject was walking up a staircase during the test
    WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (3): subject was walking down a staircase during the test
    SITTING (4): subject was sitting during the test
    STANDING (5): subject was standing during the test
    LAYING (6): subject was laying down during the test
